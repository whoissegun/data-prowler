# DataProwler

**DataProwler** is an intelligent, prompt-based web scraping system that automatically searches for information across the internet, identifies relevant sources, and extracts the data you need - all from a simple natural language query.

## üöÄ The Vision

Traditional web scraping requires knowing which sites to target, understanding their structure, and writing custom scripts for each one. DataProwler eliminates these barriers by:

1. Translating your natural language prompt into effective search queries
2. Finding and prioritizing the most relevant websites 
3. Intelligently scraping content across different site structures
4. Handling dynamic content, anti-bot measures, and various data formats
5. Returning clean, consolidated results

## üîç Key Features

- **Prompt-to-Query Engine**: Convert natural language into optimized search terms
- **Intelligent Site Discovery**: Automatically find the most relevant sources
- **Universal Content Extraction**: ML-powered scraping that works across different site structures
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Navigate pagination, JavaScript-rendered content, and interactive elements
- **Bot Detection Evasion**: Sophisticated fingerprinting and behavior patterns to avoid blocks
- **Ethical Scraping**: Built-in rate limiting and robots.txt respect
- **Multi-source Integration**: Combine and deduplicate data from multiple sites
- **Flexible Output Formats**: Export to JSON, CSV, or structured text

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Status

DataProwler is currently in early alpha development. We're working on building the core architecture and training the ML models necessary for intelligent content recognition.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethics & Usage

DataProwler is designed with ethical web scraping in mind:
- Respects robots.txt directives
- Implements rate limiting to avoid overwhelming sites
- Attributes data sources in results
- Provides opt-out mechanisms for site owners

Please use this tool responsibly and respect the terms of service of websites you interact with.

## üîÆ Roadmap

- **Q2 2025**: Core architecture and ML models
- **Q3 2025**: Basic search and scraping functionality
- **Q4 2025**: Advanced content extraction and bot evasion
- **Q1 2026**: Public beta with UI and API
